          <h2>Rahul M An Inspiration</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Rahul M is a Software Engineer working on TCS with three plus years experience. He was regularly posting videos about like How face the interview, Programming Skills Tutorial, Software Company Roles, Developers Programmers Salaries etc. However most of videos are not useful like how attract others, personal care products, job reviews, placements paid promotions etc.

                Apart from this he also posting How Impress Girls, How Giftâ€™s Girl, Love Tips for college students and more. But this is was unwanted because through this students are spoil their career. So here my suggestion was Mr.Rahul please avoid those type of categories. Because we are living in digital world so please think out of the box & give quality of contents which is helps to get a job. Then only we able to earn money in legit ways otherwise those money not worth for our career.
